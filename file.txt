He lived in England for 2 years then moved to Amman, Jordan where he lived there for
10 years. Steve then moved to Cyprus to study at the Mediterranean University.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed and returned to Jordan. His parents were very
unhappy so he decided to try in America.
He applied to many colleges and universities in the States and finally got some
acceptance offers from them. He chose Wichita State University in Kansas. His major
was Bio-medical Engineering. He stayed there for bout six months and then he moved
again to a very small town called Greensboro to study in a small college.
